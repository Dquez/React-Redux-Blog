# React-Redux-Blog

## This is a simple Blog website that utilizes a third-party backend server to store posts. 

All ajax requests are done using [axios]("https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios"), and this site was bootstrapped using a [react-redux-starter]("https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter")
